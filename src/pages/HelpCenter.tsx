      question: "How do I create an account?",
      answer: "Click 'Get Started' in the navigation bar, fill in your details, verify your email, and complete the KYC process. It takes less than 5 minutes."
    },
    {
      question: "How does escrow protection work?",
      answer: "When you initiate a trade, your payment is held securely in our escrow system. The seller only receives funds after you confirm receipt of the cryptocurrency. This protects both parties."
    },
    {
      question: "What payment methods are supported?",
      answer: "We support bank transfers, credit/debit cards, PayPal, Venmo, Cash App, and various other payment methods depending on your region."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a transaction take?",
      answer: "Most transactions are completed within 15-30 minutes. The time depends on the payment method chosen and how quickly both parties respond."
    },
    {
      question: "What fees does Arcanum charge?",
      answer: "We charge a small 1% transaction fee on completed trades. There are no hidden fees or monthly subscriptions."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I verify my identity?",
      answer: "Go to your profile settings, click 'Verification', and upload a government-issued ID and proof of address. Verification typically takes 1-2 business days."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have a dispute?",
      answer: "Open a support ticket through your transaction page. Our dispute resolution team will review the case and help resolve it within 48 hours."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my cryptocurrency safe?",
      answer: "Yes! We use cold storage for all user funds, multi-signature wallets, and bank-level encryption to keep your assets secure."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel a transaction?",
      answer: "Yes, you can cancel before payment is confirmed. Once payment is in escrow, cancellation requires agreement from both parties or dispute resolution."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I contact support?",
      answer: "You can reach our 24/7 support team through live chat, email (support@arcanum.com), or by opening a ticket in your account dashboard."
